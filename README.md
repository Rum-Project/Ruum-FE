Welcome to RÃ¼m! If you're looking for your next musical practice space, you're in the right place. After perusing the landing page, feel free to search all available rooms (we've got about 20 right now), filter by available instruments, amenities, or cost, view extra room details, and book your next practice space!

A user is free to search all rooms and see room details, but if they want to Book a Room or access the Dashboard page, they will be prompted to log in. Please see the [Installation and Set-Up](#installation-and-set-up) section for the credentials.

If a user is interested in seeing all of their past and future bookings, they can navigate to the Dashboard page for a snapshot view of every booking they've made. If either the "upcoming bookings" or the "past bookings" sections are empty, the application will prompt the user to make some new bookings and practice more so that they can make it to Carnegie Hall.
